AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark"
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com."

AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.

AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright

AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,1,"I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it. Although it looks Identical to the $120 model, you can not adjust the brightness. That would have been good information before I bought it."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,This is a nice bare-bones reading device. Easy to set up and use. My greatest issue is that it isn't back lit so it can't be used w/o a light on in the room. Returning it an purchasing a paperwhite instead.

AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,I've wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when BB put it on sale. I am not disappointed.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.

AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,I bought this with paper white and didn‚Äôt see much of a difference in terms of resolution and use. I totally recommend this reader as it‚Äôs so small and powerful!
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,The sales people are really nice and knowledgeable to me I will come back again
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,I'm a longtime Kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift. She loved it!
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"Overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"The kindle has come in very handy lately, I always have a book to read and this is great to just grab on the go. Battery life is great, only drawback is no backlight."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I already has an older version of the Kindle, but this one is even better. I love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"Amazon kindle products have always been reliable, consistent quality and this is no different. Very happy with it."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,working well and very cheap if we think in the price way
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"This Kindle doesn't have a lighted screen like the pricier models but it has a higher dpi screen than the lower model. It's exactly what I needed, nothing more, nothing less. I've had no problems with the reader at all so far so I'll give it 5 stars."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,The kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"After the first one stopped working after only 3 weeks-best Buy replaced it with no fuss and it's going great. Small, lightweight (so fits in a purse/handbag) and with the anti-glare screen you can read in direct sunlight"
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,I bought this as a gift to my dad and he loves it. Well worth if you dont plan on reading in dark.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,the future of reading you just have this and it is like a whole library
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"This is a great way to read books on the go. There's no backlight, so reading in darker rooms may be hard. But it's affordable and portable and a great way to take all your books with you."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I love the Kindle, it is a great product. It reduces eye strain so I enjoy reading on it. This is my second Kindle."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,i bought this as a backup. I am currently using the same headphone.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"We got the Kindle for our daughter who accompanied us to try out the two Kindle models. We were willing to buy either one and we assumed she would want the more expensive one with the backlighting feature. But as she tried both, she gravitated with certainty toward the basic model. ""Why would U want to read in the dark?"" She said. As the weeks and months have gone by, she says she's completely happy with the basic Kindle, it's exactly what she wanted. Perfect."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"Good, able to read under bright sunlight conditions too"
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,Very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,I purchased this product because I love to read and buying books got costly. With this product I can read all I want for 10.00 a month
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,it is smaller than i thought but it gets the job done.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"Product is good, light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy, Books are easy to download. Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,Easy to use and it arrived exactly as described. Good beginner device for youngsters who want a device to read from.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,1,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,My fiance really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,Great product and service and the sales man r really nice.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"My wife loves it, replaces a Kindle from like 2003."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"It's small, light, and easy to read from. I just wish I would have spent the extra 30 bucks and got the paperwhite. The more i use this one the more I wish I had the option of a backlight. If you're on the fence as I was, go with the paperwhite! However if the backlight is not an issue, this device is great and I would recommend it."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,This device is good for entry level reader only in daylight.Its doesnot support reading in dark. To read in dark you will have to purchase a light or cover case with light attached. I either case it will put a lot of strain in your eyes.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"I love my new Kindle. The size is perfect. It fits right in my purse. Easy to navigate and I love the touch screen. I am able to read outside without a glare. Only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark I need a book light. I don't mind that so much, I just wish kindle would come out with a case for this Kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation Kindle."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,2,it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,"I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,"This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"As always, great job! Very easy to use and it's always with me. Only problem I have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. Keep up the good work"
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"I especially like the Amazon has a system to convert pdf to kindle format. Some of the things I read (journal articles) are in pdf format and I can email them to my kindle email and it shows up on my kindle with kindle format (larger text). You can find your kindel email at your account information. Only thing, I would have like a screen little larger."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,Im happy to have it. Very comfortable and easy to use every where
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,4,"This is my eighth Kindle. Some others were either lost or screen-damaged. I bought it as a spare. Current model is better looking than earlier versions (white case), sturdier, and has an improved screen. Great price also; wish I'd bought two."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.

I'm back to reading so much more often as I always have several books with me at all times! At first it surprised me that this version doesn't have a back light and you need a light to read, but I actually like it now as I don't get the eye strain like I do when using my phone."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,3,"I love having real books, but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes."
AVqVGZNvQMlgsOJE6eUY,"Amazon Kindle E-Reader 6"" Wifi (8th Generation, 2016)",Electronics,5,It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.

Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that's nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced, and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"The Amazon echo is excellent. Easy to set up, and we now use it to automate the entire house from our air-conditioning thermostat to every light in the house with the Phillips hue bulbs. We went and got one for everyone in our family."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking, lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I have only been using my Amazon Echo Show for a couple days now but it works great. The microphone picks up my voice very easily, the sound quality is great, and it looks nice sitting on my coffee table!"

This product removes those barriers.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I love my echo show I wish you could watch movies or tc shows or you tube so hopefully they will add that soon.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love all my Echo products and this one is exceptional as well. Was able to look in my house while away. Waiting for more update for access to apps in the future.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"It's at its heart an echo, but having a screen on it, with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Amazon - Echo Show is the best of all my Amazon products. I love the hands-free but able to see things on the screen.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I‚Äôm a big echo fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot, but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging, my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It's a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera ,and boom, there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve, but since the other one is going to my son, he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance, but want to see if it can do more than weather, music and turning off the lights..."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,By far my favorite Amazon product. I bought one for every bedroom in the home.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes, so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too, it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though, but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly, to have lyrics on the screen when music is played!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",2,"I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon , i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code, nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing , i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ...."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Alexa runs my entire house. The Echo show is a great addition to the Echo family. Everyone needs one!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Replaced a regular echo with this unit. Allows video chat with our son in college and replaces a digital picture frame at a very affordable price.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We love the echo show. Best feature is the flash bringing that gives us a rundown on news and weather each morning.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Along with fire TV, a prime membership, an amazon music subscription, other home automation devices and the Alexa app on the phone this system is very functional."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"It‚Äôs Alexa, but it has a screen, and it sounds pretty decent for a countertop device. My wife loves having it in the kitchen for recipes, weather music and fun!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I purchased this as present for a friend and since I have an Echo I can video chat with her to check in. The quality of the video is great.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Like having another person in the house, I talk to Alexa more then my wife"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I really love it I use it everyday and it works great
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We struggled with a surprise Christmas gift this year. The store sales rep suggested this and it was a hit!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Show is a game changer, it's amazing as are all the Echo's but with this one you can watch video's, or see who's at your door. The things that Echo can do are limitless, it's like having a personal assistant."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Another great product by Amazon, super fun and great for entertaining the family and guests."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Gift for a relative they said they loved the gift.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Same as echo but with a screen which adds to the appeal to this product.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Purchased this because I was buying the echo dot for my daughter and thought this would be fun for the family. We play music every day on it. Every one in the family is enjoying it. Only dislike is that it doesn‚Äôt have the hub.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I live the echo show! So easy to set up and use. I have one in the kitchen and one in our main bathroom.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"Alexa may be new, but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges, it should come with better instructions, including what specifically to download into one's device (iPhone, etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe, it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I love the echo show it is in my kitchen and we use it almost daily to listen to music while we cook and also to find new recipes to try, my kids use it to help with homework, my whole family uses it with ease and everyone loves it."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love it took the place off the echo in my bedroom.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought it as a gift for my parents and they absolutely love it!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We love that even our four year old can tell Alexa to ""call papa"" or Alexa turn on the kitchen lights!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I find myself saying to my phone, ""Alexa, play........."". I wish they made it for my car too."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Love how the echo show integrates with smart house devices and cameras.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Not going to lie - we haven‚Äôt even opened it yet. Planning on getting it all setup tomorrow night. I did see it at the store though & it was incredible
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports, etc. Still not using it to its full potential, but we have it controlling a couple of lamps, giving us weather reports, setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I recently purchased the Amazon show. It was easy to setup and use and I also added my own specialty screens and home screen. Extremely glad I bought it.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,we enjoy asking it questions about history & educational stuff for kids.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I LOVE MY ECHO SHOW, ELEXA IS SO HELPFULL SHE ANSWERS JUST ABOUT EVERY QUESTION I HAVE"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The Amazon Echo Show is a great addition to any connected home. Allows me to link Phillips Hue and Nest systems to control with voice. Great display and available information is awesome.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Worked as advertised - easy to set up and link to my wi-fi.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I love how you are able to get a visual effect along with audio from Alexa
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I think it is worth the sale price of $150.00 but it has limitations. For example it shows my calendar but you can only see the first item, then if you ask for more, you see the next 3 or so. I The screen is updating with trivia...some interesting some not so much. I bet the next generation is a lot better"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Everyone should have this product. It‚Äôs great to have when you are needing to see something and your hands are full or you can‚Äôt find your phone.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"When I first read about Amazon Echo Show, I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size, which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras, so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2, so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date, with stronger bass, directional stereo, Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder, with less sound to the sides & back, so you do not share your music to all, as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7"" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator; Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa, just as with Echo or Dot, & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen, with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days, including real feel, a picture of the anticipated weather, chance of rain, etc. 11- Say: Alexa, show me the ""Front Porch"", or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds, there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet, so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device, this is one you will want in the center of your desk, as shown in my photo, because once you add the video component, you will wonder how you enjoyed music, sports, & just about everything, without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast, that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT, but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is actually for a gift. Second one I purchased But great priduct
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,I‚Äôve asked itquestions and answers were unknown and could not help me
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Great product. Easy to use .very easy to set up ..

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We love our echo. Use it everyday. One thing, it claims to pick up your voice from anywhere in the room, but that's not always the case. It's not a big deal, just get a little closer or louder and she follows the request/answers the question. Love it!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Nice add on to work with Arlo pro cams or if you like to sing karaoke with alexa
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies, YouTube videos etc."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I bought the white version and have it in the kitchen. I use it for EVERYTHING, music, video, phone, security cams, news, weather. It's the perfect kitchen assistant."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,If you like the Amazon Echo or the echo Dot you will love this for me the best part is when you make list or listen to music it puts the words on the screen for you
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside ""smart"" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"She is Alexa, better younger sister. Love her, and some of the new skills great"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The show has a good picture and good sound...love using it to look things up
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do, but my favorite part is the screen. It‚Äôs not a huge deal, but if I could change one thing it would be a detachable power cable instead of hardwired."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"It‚Äôs good, but not google smart, it answers when no one asks. Kind of spooky. The distinction in the voice context is absent"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I like the ease and usage of the amazon show. I have a amazon echo and I decided to upgrade to this for the video call. Overall great product!

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I bought the echo after seeing it demonstrated by my brother. He proceeded to ask Alexa questions and Alexa would answer them immediately. He then asked it to pull up some songs which, it did right away. Then he asked it to call mom and it did that as well. Needless to say, i had to get one."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device. My minor complaints are that it is slightly smaller than expected and you can‚Äôt view YouTube videos on it. Not huge deals at all, but minutely disappointing."

Doesn‚Äôt replace room camera but good. Would give a 5 but can‚Äôt figure out how to have other alexa owners drop in on her. Anyone know?"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Great product. Absolute love it. Alexa is fun to converse with and has a wealth of information

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",2,It was a bit more involved getting set up but thereafter the function is simply talking to Alexia. The plug adapter to turn on and off lights TV is useful and certainly worth having.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Adds some nice tricks to the regular Echo lineup. Video calls to other Show owners works well. Speakers sound good.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"THE ECHO SHOW WORKS WELL, BUT AT THIS TIME IT CANNOT CONNECT TO YOUTUBE. MAYBE WHEN AMAZON WAKES UP THE CONNECTION WILL BE RETURNED."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"It's a lot of fun. To fully enjoy it, we had to get Amazon music unlimited. We bought four of them, so we can keep in touch with family. Alexa is very entertaining!"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,i love the addition of my echo show to my other Alexa devices. Having the screen to read recipes and viiew notes is great!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather, markets, and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly, the product is top of the line technology, and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it, and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect; it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand, and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen, and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb, with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well, but it only works with android, Samsung, Fire OS, IOS device, excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions, and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App, which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved, is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words, and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices, so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well, for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Love the echo show so much! Easy to use, connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can't compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights, simple cooking measurements, simple math, travel time, store location hours, calling, and video calling.... and more. Everything else like, news, calendars, weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love the many features ! Highly recommend it! using the echo saves me lots of unnecessary work... and that‚Äôs amazing!

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"I like my Show, but i can't say i love it, for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices, it has probably the worst microphone. Getting it to respond is frustrating at times, where i have no problem with a standard echo. besides this, it all works as advertised. I'd wait for the second generation, i'm sure they can work the kinks out."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I have multiple echos and dots but this one is way better.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Show is a very awesome product because of Alexa itself! She will answer questions you ask her, play music on your demand, and you can even ask her to make calls and video chats for you. I also like the fact that it sounds very nice and the video quality is unlike anything I've ever seen in a hybrid tablet product. A must have for your home!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,it works well and sounds very good and the pictures are good too
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Bought the Echo Show because of the display and am not disappointed. The Echo was purchased for somebody as a gift but this was purchased for me and is working great. The only thing that I am disappointed with is that I have to go through Bluetooth to play my music which is on iTunes. The display is also very vivid and clear.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",1,Purchased this device at launch (2 pack for $384.xx) and now YouTube doesn't work. YouTube was one of the main features that I used. Without YouTube you'll be better off buying the $40 Echo Dot instead.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I‚Äôm in love with Alexa.

Learn cooking techniques, recommended cooking times...endless list of available answers. Great addition to my kitchen. LOVE that we can play Christmas music throughout our home using all our Echo devices. Lots of fun. This works just like all echo products,,,.with smart accessories you can control your home thermostat, lights etc. Alot of expandable options."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I got this as a spur of the moment thing. I figured it was going to be super gimmicky but was pleasantly surprised that it's actually a very helpful device for organizing, shopping, smart home control, listening to music, or even watching some videos while I'm washing dishes. My show is in my kitchen and I've used it for countless things. I think this is amazon's best Alexa yet."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he loves it! He is able to change the screen picture from his phone so there are different pictures everyday. Nice to tell Alexa to keep track of what we need at the store. Can‚Äôt wait to use it more!

My wife and daughter absolutely love it, and they ask Alexa questions and to play their favorite music all the time. The display is very nice, and I love the sleek look of it. Amazon has outdone itself."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,My daughter bought a show so my 10 year old grandson could get in touch with her when he got home from school so I bought one so he could call us and we can see each other. We love it.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great addition to the amazon device family. Great Christmas gift.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We purchased the Amazon - Echo Show with Alexa in store. Took it home and after connection wi-fi it was great. we cannot wait to buy light bulbs and a thermostat. Great buy

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I already have 6 Amazon devices (2 Echo's and 4 Dot's). I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen, and most of them have been very helpful. I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She'll get a kick out of it also."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale), this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is ""show"", so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo, but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone, this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show, so that you can do ""drop in"", which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home, so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream, too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as ""play"" or ""start"" or ""open"") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms, one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming, I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe, which is possible, but very sensitive and if you miss, here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :)
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,No real upgrades to the iPhone 7 from the 6. There is no learning curve for sure. However the camera is better and that is a plus.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I had an Alexa, but thought the show would be cool as it would allow me to link a camera to it, see videos for info I wanted to look up, play my prime video account. It would have been a 5 if I could see all prime shows/movies on it."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The echo show works great for home automation. Being able to see your security cameras or drop in on your home through the echos camera are great features.

You can even use it like Skype with others who have a show."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"My wife wanted this, so I got it as a gift.

Each room in my house has some kind of smart speaker (I have also Google Home devices).The Echo Show is the best device to use in a living room or kitchen. The screen is bright and sharp, and it's a nice feature to follow recipes, watch videos or even listen to music once the lyrics are displayed on the screen.It's also the best way to see calendar entries, to do and shopping lists."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I love the show. It was so easy to set up. I use it every day for music and weather info. Can'y wait to see how it works for Christmas cookies.

I've used it as a timer, I've listened to Iheart radio, I love the smart lights that I bought at the same time. Alexa turns them on/off when I tell her to. When the holiday rush is over, I will go online to learn many more things."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Best item I ever use. I would love to get another one.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Alexa does a lot of fun things but you must enable various apps. She gives funny answers to funny question. However, she is not a complete internet surfer, many things she has no answer."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I bought it for my son in laws birthday after they bought me one for Christmas. Not just good for music but helpful for grandkids homework and now we can video chat with grandkids, which the one year old loves!"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"I got this to work with my Arlo Pro camera, and it works well. I am able to have my camera for driveway and front door come up on command. I hate that I cannot get my Samsung TV to come on with a verbal request. I guess I will have to buy the plug for it. This was very easy to set up. Downloaded the app, and plugged it in, viola it walks you through the setup."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",1,"I waited a couple months to review giving Amazon time to make this product equal to the SONY Dash from nearly a decade ago, it isn't the screen provides nothing of value and you can't turn of amazon tips! you have near zero customization can't even move the clock to the other side of the screen. And something that a sony dash did nearly 10 years ago pandora or prime music as an alarm! seriously this is the biggest fail! Run away from this half baked Amazon disaster!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Im impressed with it. I can monitory my Arlo cameras at when ever i want and I can treat my Sirius radio

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This Alexa device is great fun, and useful for several personal assistant type applications. I use it in conjunction with some TP-Link Light switches, and it works flawlessly. It is nice to see the lyrics to songs she plays, and calling other people who have the show or spot works well. She is also really good at setting reminders and alarms. Another useful feature is as an in home intercom."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I Love this I don't even have to turn on my tv I just talk to Alex a and she does what I tell her.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It's nice to see my calendar and the sound is good too.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"Its a great product, but for the cost, the speakers are not what they should be, and the screen is too small. Choosing what is desplayed on the screen is something i still have not figired out. Hopefully software updates will fix the minor problem, and a second generation will hopefully fix the hardware downfalls. Voice recognition is also not as good as the eco dot. I am not recomending this product at this time because of the cost and poor performance."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Easy setup for connections to wi-fi cameras, Amazon Digital Subscriptions and coming soon....YouTube. Add your videos and BOOM...to the screen they come."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"This is an awesome device, but it isn't life changing. It is basically the same as the Echo. I don't use the video much."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Amazing how much stuff this can do everything from a alarm clock to listening to music,asking questions and controlling devices .the sound front the speakers is really great."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,We really are enjoying asking Alexa questions and she is connected to our Sonos system playing music around the house. She doesn‚Äôt always understand me. Not sure if it is her or me.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims, the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also, not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up, the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Got one for my mom in order to video chat with her. Works awesome.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning, the morning commute traffic report. Recipes, facts, phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over, they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Amazing. I seriously didn't know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this), having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes, random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos, the security cameras connected to your house, listen to music and watch the baby sleep. I love my Echo Show."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price, I couldn't order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product), make video calls to other Show owners, voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won't make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the 'other' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two, disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon's Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a '68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid, ""Easier than fallin' of a log and not near as dangerous."""

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I love the Alexa system of assistance. This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up. You need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private. I installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use.

I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, but not an option. The only thing that's is not as good as my previous ones is that I feel the microphone does not understand me as well.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"The three star review is for the situation described here, not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up, however, it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this, and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit, but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale, and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up, make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot, except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo's this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat, but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well, but you'll probably just watch that on a phone, tablet or TV instead."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"Great sound, easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I've been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I'm just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Not only does it round out my collection of Alexa devices, I have two echos and one dot, it also works well with the Ring 2 Video Door Bell,I can see who is at my front door without opening it."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It is amaizin I like the way you type and search my favorites
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",1,"Worthless, except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices, bathroom, pool, kitchen, other places where I may need hands free, voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest, hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me ""Alexa find videos on f450 drone"" Alexa ""YouTube is not available"". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products, youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Got this for my dad for Christmas. He likes that the speakers sound better. He also enjoys being able to make video calls with it.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great device for me because I already owned bunch of stuff that supports Alexa. Needs more skills. And need YouTube to work!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,If you like video this goes along perfect ...a must buy
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Purchased the Echo Show for my wife and she loves it! Full of great information, weather and more. Can control lights and various things at the house. Even askes you the question of the day! Easy set up and to use. Mainly bought it to monitor the Arlo Pro 2 cameras we purchased."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,Only download was very slow and echo show didn‚Äôt make it worth having as a stand alone
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Great device. Love Alexa being able to pull up home cameras to view!!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I feel the audio on the show is the best when compared to the echo, echo 2.0, and obviously dot. Nice to have next to bed instead of a dot and an alarm clock"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This amazon echo show is great for room monitoring. It was priced well and I find it useful.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,We are new to connected home equipment. I got this for my wife in our kitchen. The only thing I wish was different would be that the Amazon Show would communicate directly with FaceTime rather than having to have someone download the Alexa app. Not a deal breaker by any means though. We love it
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I love my new Alexa Show. Checked prices thoroughly and Best Buy was was the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and 5 minutes away. Product is great. Easy setup and works as stated. Staff very helpful.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"We purchased the Echo Show for Christmas this year, and love it so much! Our kids got the hang of it faster than we did (ages 11 and 13)! Highly Recommend!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We bought the Amazon Echo Show for my dad.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great sound and picture. Been using as a baby monitor. Still new to Alexa so still learning what she can do
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"The Echo was so good, I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons, one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day, I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying,""Google is not supported on Echo Show."" Until YouTube comes back as a skill, the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify, or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Having LOTS of fun with Alexa! Tells us weather, stories, plays music trivia games with us, helps with shopping list, and can face to face talk with my sister in another state (bought one for her too) - great addition to our home!"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Show is a version of Alexa with ability to visualize things. When I was cooking dinner and wanted to finish a show, I was able to ask Alexa to play the show from my Amazon Prime account. The Show was in my kitchen, easy to view, and enabled my kids to watch cartoons in the living room. I love it!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Everybody enjoys this product.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I saw there was a new Echo with a screen and had to have it. I use it for Amazon Prime videos, YouTube, music with lyrics, recipes, and viewing the nursery with Amazon Cloud cam. The speaker is louder than I thought. Good purchase but I‚Äôd like to see more features for the screen."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,This is the main reason why I went with Amazon's Echo ecosystem vs Google Home. I bought one as a gift to my sister so I can easily videochat with my family. My niece and nephew tend to fight over the Echo Show when they want to sing along to their favorite songs with the lyrics on the screen. My only wish was that there was an HDMI out to connect it to a larger monitor. Huge missed opportunity in my opinion.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,I'm disappointed. Sometimes gives doesn't understand
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Echo show not only plays your music it puts up the lyrics to read from
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I didn‚Äôt think I would like the Echo Show ‚Äîespecially at the $200+ price point, but I tried it and love it!

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Show is a great improvement from the original Echo device. It's great being able to ""see"" what is going on!!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. ."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Bought as a gift for my wife, she loves it and the screen is very handy for recipes and such."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We have echos throughout the whole house and have this in the kitchen. Controls lights , you can FaceTime , my wife uses it for recipes and it shows the videos of directions"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"This item is a great addition to your smart home, but just as the first gen Siri it is not all there yet. The kinks still needs to be worked out. Alexa does not have answers to a lot of things or commands. There's a long learning curve. Setting up with apps is a lot work. It's fun if your large circle is willing to spend the money to get one each. Great landline replacement."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We are enjoying our amazon echo show. Alexa is so amazing answering questions and a variety of music!!!!

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",2,Needs to be a stand alone device. I should have not required to use a tablet of Cell phone to make it work. Amazon needs to work on the technology on device.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I don't know why I waited so long to bring Alexa into my home. It's how I listen to my music now, dictate my shopping and to-do lists and get my morning weather report just to name a few. I highly recommend this item."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The show works great with my other products. Love it
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I was hesitant, and I am now hooked. This is both fun and useful"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I got this for a really good price.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I already the Echo Dot and saw Amazon advertising for the new show over the summer. Got it as a gift and personally I love it. The speakers and sound from it are great. Plays the lyrics for any songs you have going, so you can karaoke without sucking now. Also displays the time, since I got rid of cable and no longer have that it is nice to have a clock in the living room. Very easy to interact with!"

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents, its ease of use is ideal for them, no computer knowledge needed, speak and they can connect with us."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Best New Adult Toy in years! Wish I had purchased one for my parents. LOVE IT!!!!

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Between this product and Siri, AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit, the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo, but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one, this is a deal worth taking."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We use it to talk to our granddaughter, play games, listen to music and check on the dog while we are at work! Awesome device! We already bought one for our kids also!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice."

Highly recommend the echo."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The show is our new best friend. We watch shows on it everyday at lunch time. And we end every night saying ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off screen‚Äù"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"this is pretty cool, we love ours, we listen to music and the sound is great, my kids are always asking her questions, we can call on it, set reminers, timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you, like even though I have a prime membership, all music is not available , I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there, even though I upgraded it ,if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time, to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Already an amazon consumer and user of Alexa to control home automation products.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great product. I‚Äôm at the beginning stages of having a smart home and this was the perfect addition.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I love the fact that I can just use my voice to use my electronic devices.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Bought for sons & family they have small children and I never miss out on seeing them live .. love it
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It is very enjoyable to be able to listen to the music at any time and great for parties and poolside.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"This is a very nice concept, and I think it will take on more usefulness as Alexa gains more skills. The design is a little clunky.... Google's version looks nicer, but I already has Alexa devices to tie in to."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"The sound quality is good,Alexa responds to commands but their is room for improvement"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Very similar to FaceTime on an Apple product.You can watch someone show you how to do something, like a project you are working on. Instead of listening, you can see it!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Alexa is now a family member. How have I lived my life without her I have no idea...........
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Nice except unlike a Google Home you can‚Äôt just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Alexa is there to answer those questions you do not have an answer for along with news and weather
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is a fantastic item & the person I bought it for loves it.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Echo Show is everything I thought it would be and more. The alarm and music actions are the greatest.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"It syncs with my Echo, displays slideshows, recipes, and lists, controls my Fire Stick, and sounds pretty good. It doesn't play You Tube videos but it does do a good job playing videos."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents, who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen. Also watching news segments and looking at cooking recipes/videos is great. It‚Äôs also the easiest to set up of the Echo Devices, you don‚Äôt even need to use the app,"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this for my business to monitor the arlo security cameras and it is amazing!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it's great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it's random invitations to ""try"" certain skills, but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con's that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can't differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too, and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This is my 5th Amazon Alexa product. I used to have the Alexa Echo, but moved that up to my bedroom. Now I use the Echo Show downstairs and has good sound quality. I also like that I can add my Home Security system to operate through it and can see all my cameras. Great product."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Works well. Haven't been able to work out the local traffic yet.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love my amazon echo show however I wish Alexa knew a little bit more.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this as a gift for my daughter's 22nd birthday and she totally loved it. Now she's wanting me to buy a second one so that I can keep it on the first floor. She says we can communicate through them instead of yelling to each other. I think it was a great purchase so I think I'm going to have to buy another one.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Works good. Have to be very careful with kids. Overall good product
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"It's neat. It does what all other amazon alexis' do, but a little more. I feel as if should still do more."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is a great device when used with Ring camera and Hue lighting.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Thoroughly enjoy my new show. Love the scrolling pictures.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I brought my tube amplifier to Best Buy and my Magnolia rep hooked it up to a pair of B&W 700 Series 2 speakers. WOW...It sounded like Etta James was right in the room! Fantastic!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Works great. Very responsive and quick. I love tying the whole house together with this and the echoes.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Love the look- love the size- love that it is VISUAL!!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I like it. Currently it is the only smart system with display. It makes it easier to talk to the device. My only issue with it that it has a slow processor.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Yes, it‚Äôs a little glitchy sometimes. But so useful and fun! I‚Äôm hoping that over time Amazon will continue to improve on the errors in Alexa. When contacting customer service, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Amazon is very interested in learning the problems that need fixing though."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Great item to upgrade your house. Works very well.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Very cool - It fully incorporates all of my Smart Home products
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Very happy with adding Alexa to the kitchen! The Echo Show is great for looking up recipes, getting a weather and traffic up as I‚Äôm getting my morning coffee or just listening to music!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",1,"Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Makes things easy to do like listen to music, check the weather, hear the news,etc. just make sure you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loans and clear. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hear you."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Great to have for time, recipe, or entertainment I recommend everyone get it"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This amazon product is amazing easy to set up and to use. I do recommend getting prime music with it for only 4.99 a month that‚Äôs a deal.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The family and I love Alexa view and once we got it we were hooked now everything in the house and outside is run by voice commands. The opportunities with this are endless.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets, our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it's hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we're happy with the purchase."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore, and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Amazon hit it out of the park with this one. I am able to connect this to NEST cams and Ring cams as well. Songs come with lyrics, sound and looks great."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Echo Show does everything from weather to turning on/ off my lights
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,loved the echo show. my only complaint is that youtube will no longer be available on it. That is one of the main reasons I purchased this as a gift. Other than that the product is great. Easy to use.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This Amazon Echo is very user friendly, and provides hours of entertainment, with anything from recipes, news, videos, and Amazon music with the lyrics is like having your own Karaoke."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I have multiple Echo devices so purchasing another was a no brainer. I enjoy this one as it is video capable. The only thing I wish they would add was a way to pivot the camera and or improve its low light capabilities for poorly lite rooms.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music, most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member, pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs, outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up, so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show, you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions, do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show, she's your girl, but if you want to know something, you might have to look it up yourself. IE; weather forecast, you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches, I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all, very fun, helpful, item. It can order you pizza too."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Is better than face time when calling my kid, since they have one, IÔ∏è could call them from my and see them at the same time, perfect for cooking timer n best for music"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I have really enjoyed these products so much I actually bought 3 of them. Fun to watch and even better if you are an Amazon Prime customer for music and video.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,As advertised......................................
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I love my echo show it does so many interesting things I‚Äôm on it all the time I recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting up to date information
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I am enjoying the Echo Show a lot.Very entertaining
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Absolutely love the Amazon Alexa devices, we now have six in our house and have them connected to Sonos, nest, Arlo and other devices"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I purchased it so the weather and info can be seen on the screen. At the time I never knew there was an echo spot or I would have tried that. The show sounds good however I wish there was a ring or something on top that would light up like the original alexa.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Easy to install, very easy to use, we enjoy the product and learn more about it all the time"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great item for the new home. Better than purchasi. This is a good product
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We have the original Echo, two Echo Dots and the Echo Show to complete the family - love the ability to play videos and the lyrics display on Prime Music is awesome!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Bought two of these. one for the living room and one for the bedroom. great when you dont feel like walking to the living room and need to talk to your significant other. honestly dont use it much, but when i do its great. music shopping stupid questions movie times etc."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this for our kitchen where we enjoy cooking and congregating. Streaming music is great and you can search for recipes just by asking Alexa.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Our whole family loves, and uses this device for so many different features. We love using it to make phone calls, watch films, play Jeopardy, even to define words as they come up in conversation. We definitely get a lot of use out of this device, more than any other screen, tablet, or smart phone device we own."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"FUN TO USE FOR ANY AGE JUST SAY ALEXA"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"A nice ""next step"" in the Alexa repertoire; easy to set up and to use."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,It is so convenient to have a display with Alexa function.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I Searched online and talked with people for two weeks before purchasing. When I went to purchase the echo show amazon dropped the price. Love this product am glad I purchased it. Having a blast listening to any kind of music and asking questions.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen, but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also, we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately, this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras, but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker, so something to think about."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"this product features a beautiful screen to enhance your viewing and information, love this product"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Simply love it! It‚Äôs loud... love watching videos!!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This product is amazing. I do however wish that there were more video features on it!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"This item seems great on the ads, but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù, some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed, but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful, but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Echo Show is a great addition to any home and we were thrilled to buy one for each of our children's families during this holiday season!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven't used this feature yet since I'm the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever, wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love the new Echo Show! Picture is clear and the microphones pick up my voice from far away. My wife likes it for recipes on the go and the Show it is always thinking. Music sounds great coming from this small unit. It was the talk of Christmas!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Got this as a gift for my sister and her fianc√© and they love it. Works great with Phillips Hue
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I love this new Alexa device with the screen. I bought it for my mother who really couldn't ""relate"" to the Echo Dot. But she can read the output. I works seamlessly with my Apple Calendar so she can see her activities of the day. Also can call her Great Grandchildren just by talking, and see them too!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I own a dot and a first gen echo and the sound from the show is way better than both of my other echoes. The video functions are nice but it is a pain to get it to play videos from my Amazon library. My family enjoys the calendar info and the news briefings that rotate on the screen.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We already love our other Alexa/Echo devices and this is our favorite. The drop in video chat feature is my favorite!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Nice to see songs, and many other items. Shows words to music, can watch u tube. And video calls."

AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I like the Echo Show. I can view my cams, watch a movie and read the news. The camera video is slightly delayed. And I do wish it had a jack for earphones. But the sound on mine is good."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I have dots and an echo and this just sounds better and looks better
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. The screen is big and alexa responds clearly and quickly.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Bought it for my son & wife. They love it. Both thought they didn‚Äôt need it. They find that it is a lot of fun and very useful.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Very impress with the echo show and all of its features
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I think this is one of Amazon best products ever. I first review the echo online and watch youtube video. It is better than I read or saw on line.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This device is seriously cool. The basic functions out of the box are nice, but some customization and configuration allow you to do so much more. My family loves the ability to play Amazon music with their voice. Smart home integration is a big draw!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Nice device. We use it a lot in the kitchen and the home automation.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,The video is pretty good and the speaker is better than I thought it would be.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"If Amazon and Google can work things out, the Show will be amazing! We already loved the Echo and the Dot, and were looking forward to adding video. Unfortunately, YouTube is no longer on the Show, limiting the video content. If they can ever get it back, the Show will definitely be a 5 star product!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The show is definitely amazing, especially if you have the doorbell with video and security cameras, you can see it with echo show."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I love this product! The possibilities are endless!
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It's great! I love the hand free whatever you want. It plays videos on Amazon by just asking it to play. At work I can video call my girlfriend at home with the show as well. Highly recommend
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Purchased to stay in touch with family while traveling.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Absolutely Awesome! Great product, recommend that Everyone have one!"
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Traded my original echo for echo show. Glad I did, screen is excellent and syncs with many home connected devices."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I upgraded from Echo and have no regrets. I didn't liked design from day 1 but after mounting on the wall the screen looks good. I like it more then I except it. Much easier for reordering or shopping on Amazon.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Amazon echo show working very well (as expected) and thanks to Amazon for adding more features on regular basis.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Delivered on time and it looked good will hook it up next year.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is the most amazing item. And very easy to use
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I use alexa to control my smart home and get internet information
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Best Xmas gift and great product made by amazon. Now my fam is all connected.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"bought these for family members out of state for Christmas, finding it is way more than expected. Can talk face to face with them, make shopping lists, listen to stories, play interactive trivia music games, is there no end to possibilities? They all LOVED their gift (thank you Best Buy for great sale to make affordable)..."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However, I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes, seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely, but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"Amazon show is pretty cool, It can help with things like cooking recipe, homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things. If Google comes out with something similar I would have definitely chosen that over the show. No YouTube."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights, alarm, vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists, keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"We're still learning all the things this device can do. So far, We're very pleased."
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition. We are able to view our security cameras from the The Echo Show and it works great in general as an Echo with all its features.
AWFUWc8THh53nbDRF6YO,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video, security camera footage, Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos, but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love it Love it Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love this. Just replaced my old echo with this one. Love Alexa.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,This is great! Like having a robot brain in your house.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is just what I was looking for. It does just what it says it does!
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This is perfect for any home it gives up to date news, you can set alarms and do so much more. We love this product"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I couldn't believe how easy and fast the setup was. It's basically plug and play. I watched a video first and it took no more than 3 minutes to get going. You don't need any other equipment to set it up. The sound is unbelievable...better than my Bose.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Echo Dot is a great personal assistant, and right now the price is fantastic. It can give you the weather forecast, traffic reports, daily news brief, play music from Pandora or other steaming radio stations, and answer questions, all in a very small package.. ."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Addition to my system...love talking and seeing my BFF in ATL...SUITS MY OFFICE decor.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We love Alexa! Love being able to watch news briefings, seeing the lyrics to songs, and so much more! It's in our kitchen and we use it everyday!"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this so my kids can talk to there Grandpa and it has been Great they call him all the time
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Now I can view my front door Ring system as well as all my Arlo cameras. Great products. If you have Echo Spot in each bedroom, you can video talk with your kids by dropping in. Love it"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Got this for my wife for Christmas. Was suppose to come wrapped but didn‚Äôt. Wife very happy. Avid amazon fan. Sound better then the echo.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Use a lot of home automation and this is a great addtion. If you are not an Alexa or home automation fan I would recomend trying to catch this on sale, you may not need the screen a much as you think. The sound quality is great."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is a great device that actually has a lot of usefulness to it. After about a week you're going to be wondering what else can I do? what else can this help you with? So my suggestion is to get one of these as a start. Then prioritize the purchase of an echo (not plus) and a spot.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock, stereo, 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC), news/weather, audiobooks, and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times, but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories, but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands, and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance, but hey, this is still relatively new tech, and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I like it. Needs more features to really become a good product. Needs browsing capabilities.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"This is a great addition to the other Alexa products by Amazon. It works great in the kitchen. Better voice recognition and sound. The onscreen display and information are very helpful. The video capability is watching instructional videos or even playing music videos while working/cooking. It can also scroll personal photos as a picture display.All in all Echo Show is a wonderful addition. Well worth it, especially if you get it on sale."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Purchased this item for our daughter. She absolutely loves it!
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"After researching and reading endless reviews, I bought myself an early Christmas present in the Amazon Echo Show. Once I had it home, it was quickly set up and has been a joy to have since day one. Loved it so much I bought two more as gifts. So enjoying being able to see friends and family on a more regular basis with the video option. I‚Äôm sure as I learn more this will become even more useful. Great addition to my other Echo devices."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Alexa is a wealth of knowledge and learning more and more every day.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen, but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list, it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I am very pleased with the sound and picture quality. It does not link to direct tv.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,This was a Black Friday special and we knew we wanted a smart home assistant and Alexa worked well with the Ring doorbell system. There are times when you have to ask her the same thing over and over until she figures it out but overall it was a food deal.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love talking face to face with family and friends back in the Philly area. It is easy to use and to stay in touch. I can show family things that I have recently bought by holding it up to the camera instead of having to go into a long description on a phone line.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"Once you have it, you can't live without it. Great product."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The show works great with my other products. Love it
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Love the echo show & the ability to communicate with smaller children without any effort or cell phones.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The echo show works very well with Bluetooth and WiFi. Great sound and screen. Recommend to anyone
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,All I really use it for is music. The read downfall is it‚Äôs not Bluetooth so it has to be plugged in 24/7
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I have all the echo products in this by far is the best it does everything . I love it!
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We're hoping the Echo show will allow us to elevate our experiences using the screen options for calling family & friends as well as reading recipes etc.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However, this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product!"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I will have one for all my rooms. I will also buy some for friends
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I can see my grandchildren when I call it is a great machine

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Absolutely Love the echo Show! It is in my kitchen. I love seeing my to do and shopping lists on there. My calendar is there too. Plus I scroll pictures on it from my Amazon prime photos. Love being able to get the daily news briefing from MPR every morning. Also use it for timing things. Would highly recommend it to Amazon prime members. Got it at a great price on sale prior to Christmas.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Amazon built upon the success of their Echo. I'm really enjoying the convenience of the Echo with the added display.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,I have put this in the kitchen to use for recipes and controlling various devices.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",2,Not a very responsive program. Very limited information program. Not user friendly.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"The Amazon Echo Show is so much fun! I got it for my husband for Christmas and its absolutely more of a gift for myself! We also got hue lights and have set it up our routines. This show is so much fun! We listen to the news in the morning while making coffee, it wakes us up with slowly with the hue lights, we listen to music while cooking dinner... cant recommend it more! Because of this purchase, I am also buying a spot! We love the camera feature where you can ""drop in"" so we will continue buying these rather than the security cameras (for the inside at least where we just want to say hello or see our dog)."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Worked better than expected! Highly recommend the Echo Show

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"at first I wasnt sure if this was something I ""needed"" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I ""needed"" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I control all my smart home sthings with it, and also have 2 echo dots"

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,With a Seamless integration and easy functionality the echo show is wonderful piece of tech that is entertaining and useful to the whole family.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",1,"Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill, made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help; less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I have the spot, dot and two shows, I started out with the spot and loved it so much I wanted a bigger one. This was a (Best Buy) ! No pun intended lol"

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Purchased for my mom in a memory care center.

It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I am loving my Amazon Echo Show. It makes life easier! I love being able to ask what the weather is going to be or play some music just by asking Alexa.

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,It is a great product. It works great would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to buy one.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"So having Alexa on hand could be good and bad.

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The touch screen adds a new dimension to the Echo which comes in handy when ordering off of Amazon or reorders as well.

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However, the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But, who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it."

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!"

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music. Unless I missed something it seems like if I set the volume low at night to listen to music to go to sleep my alarm will not be loud enough. So I don‚Äôt use the Show for music much.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"Setting up the amazon show was a little tricky,but I managed to navigate through it. It‚Äôs so cool to add compatible equipment."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Great for video calling grandparents who are not real tech savvy. They also enjoy music on demand.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"Requires too many components. Cameras, etc. stick with basics (in my opinion)."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We are loving it so far! Bought with a great deal and was able to use previous best buy awards to get it cheap. We also ended up buying another one for the parents for Christmas so we can chat back and forth! I love how all the echo's connect now in our home.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I am so happy to have the Echo Show. I have been able to listen to Christmas songs and some country western music. It has so many other things to do with it that I can not wait to try some.

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought this as a gift. As far as know it works fine
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Added screen a great features visual effect a plus
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,We use echo almost every day. It is fun to ask questions. The music is great. We check the weather and listen to NPRnews
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,"I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show, it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment, my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future."
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"I love all of my Amazon echo devices. Right now it doesn't allow YouTube, but hopefully they will reach an agreement and fix that."

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"This does the same things as the other echos but has a screen. The sound is comparable to the echo which is good. The screen is small, not hd, and not touch screen. You only can call other echo users.If you have an echo don't run out and buy you can do all on a laptop. If you are looking at an echo having the screen might be worth the extra bucks,"
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,Upgraded from echo to this and this is just what I needed. Works well with my new Ring door bell and security cameras. Love the versatility of this.
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",4,Alexa is great and even better with a screen to show you all your searches and videos
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,"First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it, but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice."

AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",3,"We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa, and home automation. After using for a week, we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn't ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the ""I can't answer that"" response to questions. It's a waste of money for us. Say ""Alexa, Say good bye!"""
AWK8z0pOIwln0LfXlSxH,"Amazon Echo Show Alexa-enabled Bluetooth Speaker with 7"" Screen","Electronics,Hardware",5,This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo.

AWMjT0WguC1rwyj_rFh3,Amazon - Echo Plus w/ Built-In Hub - Silver,"Electronics,Hardware",4,"Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided, I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound, look, etc perspective really didn't lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for 'free' was a smart move.Overall, I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects."

AWMjT0WguC1rwyj_rFh3,Amazon - Echo Plus w/ Built-In Hub - Silver,"Electronics,Hardware",5,I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service.

I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs."

In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."

I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price"

Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."

It is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this."

It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings.

AVph0EeEilAPnD_x9myq,"Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",Electronics,5,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful."

The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.

The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it.

She can set time limits, can limit access, and much more. Plus it comes with a two year guarantee , if the child breaks it, they will replace it. Did I mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity. These grandkids are 4 to 8 in age, but older kids would enjoy this also."

AVqkIh9HQMlgsOJE6fu_,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8 HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Blue",Electronics,4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."

BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!"

Overall, everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights, White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights.

The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen.

Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."

AVph0EeEilAPnD_x9myq,"Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",Electronics,5,"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi."

The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen.

Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product.

I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig, but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background, so it's less bright on the eyes."

AVph0EeEilAPnD_x9myq,"Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",Electronics,4,We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.

It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them."

It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists.

The setup was super simple, so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item, but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability.

No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests.

Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Was a little difficult to sync the first time. I really have only used the Tap to play music and to ask for the weather. I like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"would get another, works great, having fun with all the options"

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,The kids love it. They ask it silly questions which to my amazement it has an answer. I really like for the music aspect. Just tell it a song and it finds it
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,The touch is a great device to control connected home products. Perfect for outside use for prime music also.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Was very difficult to set up. With the 3 hours help of Geek Squad and my granddaughters I-Phone we got it done.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!"

I absolutely love it, and so does my husband."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I HAVE PUT THE DOT IN THE BEDROOM WHERE MY ECHO IS IN THE LIVING AREA. MY FAMILY USES HER FOR EVERYTHING. ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE ECHO / DOT.

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Works really well with echo and is really neat and fun

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,This item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands. I like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it

But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"This is actually my daughters device as I have no interest in a voice controlled spy. But, I will say that the sound from the speakers are pretty good for a small device."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I added to a ""dot"" purchase for my daughter, and she loved it! The portability and charge feature she really likes. Great gift!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"This speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that I am in.

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,This is a great product I would highly recommend getting it
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Can charge and take anywhere in the house! Holds a long charge.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa, and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right, but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,This is a awesome product. My husband and I love it.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,It exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room."

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,2,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,2,"This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Reasonably priced and worth every penny! I love it.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I use it all around the house. I move it upstairs and down. With the upgrade firmware you don't have to tap. Just say ""Alexa."" Good sound, but not as good as JBL charge speaker. I bought a 2nd one as a Christmas gift."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I was an early adoptor of the Amazon Echo, when I heard they were releasing a mobile version I wanted it. It wasn't until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how usefule this lil guy was, just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function Echo. I would buy this again if I didn't already have one."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Love it, works better than anticipated. Also at a good price"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"We have bought two Taps, one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son. We love the portability of the Tap. It's perfect for our deck. Our grandchildren love it, too."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I love my new toy. Alexa is my personal girl Friday. She understands what I want and retrieves it. Easy to set up and use.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Good price works great would buy again good value for the price
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Music, full home automation control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wifi, home or away. Get one, you will not regret it."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Omg I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet Best Buy. Play it now everyday.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Great speaker and Echo substitute. This is great for on the go as a Bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the Alexa app.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I have been enjoying the amazon tap for two weeks, and am still finding new things it will do"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding Bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny I paid useful to recommend to anybody
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music, answer questions, etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Great sound and portablebility. Nice style, lithium battery, requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news. Amazon has features available as well. I use mine a lot."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,Nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Great sound. Portable. The kids love it. Didn't think I would use it but I tend to use it a lot.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,"Speaker is pretty loud and I love that I can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the ""home"" button to use Alexa"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone/tablet unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Serves my needs as required. Sound is good. Ability to move device where required is ideal
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"The Amazon Tap is a perfect complement to our Amazon Echo. Put this in our office space...has all the advantages of the Echo and is also a great Bluetooth speaker. Having to ""tap"" the mic button to summon Alexa is no issue at all! Sound quality is as good as any Bluetooth speaker on the market and it's extremely portable."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Love Alexa. We currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis. I use one at work basically for streaming music. Great device. No problems connecting to any of them.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!"

AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Love every aspect of the Echo. We even went and bought a Tap!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"What I like is it its sound, it's portable and I use it at work. The sound fills the whole office."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Do you spend lots of time on Amazon? Do you like listening to music anywhere in your home? This is the device for you. Even after a month of having the Tap, I'm still learning what all I can do with it verbally. Play genre of music in the HUGE Amazon library. I even have ordered items directly from it. One last feature I want to share is that it provides accurate weather information; current and forecast up to a week."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I just love this tap!! It is so much fun. The music is so great. I play the relation music every night,every night. Best thing ever!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I love my smart portable speaker. It has games, weather, news, podcasts, radio stations, etc.If something is missing, I can connect my Bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application I want."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,2,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,I have an Alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling. You can use this without a plug in cord.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"If you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant, then this is the product for you. The Tap only listens to your, when you push the ""button, otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings. You get the awesome power of Alexa, provided by Amazon, and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,2,"I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,2,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Good price, travels well, has a lot of good features, compact, user friendly."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I already own an echo dot but don't love the sound quality for music playback - the tab does a great job especially when you consider its size and price - overall very happy
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I only purchased this because I loved the sound quality. Alexa is just a added bonus personally as I rarely hit the ""tap"" button to ask her anything. The few times I asked her questions, she hasn't disappointed. EXTRA: Now what would make this device amazing is if Alexa was able to connect to my Apple Music playlist! If only..."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Best speaker with Alexa enabled. Value of money!!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,1,Has a very good Bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she's pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,We love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live AM reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Tap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through iHeart Radio and the Tap is portable.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I love my tap. It sounds great and is so easy to use.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them! Very useful!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,"Much better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Great sound and functionality. Minimal kinks in programming. Love it for my bedroom.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,It makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,The Amazon tap I like other then I wish you could just say her name and she would respond. Sounds great when playing music
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how I can use Spotify with it....just say Alexa, and ask for your favorite artist....."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work, alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs. It's surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so I could take it with me while fishing."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Was easy to set up. Excellent sound quality for the price
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Easy set up and amazing usefulness, love it. I use it all the time and continue to find new ways to take advantage of all there is within Alexa. Will purchase another one for bedroom!"
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Love this product. It is nice looking, easy to carry, and the sound is amazing. Very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo. Nothing to complain about th he speaker itself. However the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also. One has to take it down just in order to charge."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Guys, the Tap does everything Echo does and it's portable! Use it at home for everything, at work on your desk for music, weather, etc, and even poolside as a portable speaker."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Amazon Tap is awesome. Seems to do everything the Echo does for a lesser price.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,3,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Great speaker and the sound is great. Use it every day. Love being able to use Alexa when attached to my network.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,"Excellent sound and fun. Very portable and easy to carry in backpack. All the features of Echo and Echo Dot but you must ""Tap"" the button before speaking."
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Great tech works well highly recommended no issues
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,5,Want to try one and Best Buy put up the best price. Th tap is good for usage on the wifi network. Use it to play music outside around the house.
AVpfpK8KLJeJML43BCuD,Amazon Tap - Alexa-Enabled Portable Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,4,"Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess."

That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?

AVqVGZO3nnc1JgDc3jGK,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Merlot, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers","Electronics,Media",5,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have."

I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading.

Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library."

It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"

AVqVGZO3nnc1JgDc3jGK,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Merlot, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers","Electronics,Media",5,"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost."

The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one...."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it."

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons), and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version"
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store.

The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great.

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas. Makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand (as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area). Sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!"
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Do most of my reading on one of my Kindles. Reading in sun light to no light is great.

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjusts. My eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Reading outside is no problem for the Voyage.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,I have been using the paperwhite for about 2 years now and this unit definitely beats it. The adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn buttons are quite useful. If you are looking for an E-Reader then this is the one for you.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,Great alternative to using tablet for reading. Only problem is trying to read a *.pdf file - it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"It is a good reading device. When the price drop to 100 dollar, it is a deal. You need to buy one at that level."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,bought this e-reader as a gift for my wife and she loves it
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,I really enjoy reading on the new Kindle Voyage. Have had other Kindle models before this one. I especially like the brightness and lightness of it.Only drawback I needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"So much better than reading on an iPad, completely worth it. I guess my only complaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in terms of responsiveness and fluidity but doesn't really impact regular usage of just page turning, only felt while browsing the library/store etc."

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"One of the things I love the most about my new Kindle is it's size. It slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of glare that I experienced with my old Kindle. It automatically adjusts to the light and I'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. I also love the battery life - it goes on forever. The case I bought makes it possible to stand my Kindle up in front of me and read while I'm eating - a must for me - I never eat alone ;)"
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different (I adore the flatness so much), and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. IMO, worth the cost"
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Kindle Voyage is easily the best e-reader with an impressive high-resolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. Loving it.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"This is my first kindle but I'm loving it. I picked it up a few days after it was released. One of the things I love the most is I'm a reader but I am not a car owner so I get almost everywhere by bike. I got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library; now my Voyage weighs less than most paperback books. An extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Love this kindle - the press side page turner is great.

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!"
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I have a previous version of the Kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Coming from a nook reader. Love the even backlighting and weight.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Purchased after theft in Seattle. It was on sale and works great.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display, it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that, in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although, it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!"
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,I got this for my sister who is in Paris and she doesn't go anywhere without it. All the benefits of a real book and none of the cons.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,Gave this to my wife for Christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle. She loves it.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"I love my Kindle Voyage, however it does not have a speaker for audio books. and changes settings ie. remaining time/pages left in book on it's own."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,3,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,Went back and forth between this and the Oasis but in the end just couldn't justify the added cost. So far I'm happy with this model.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,This is my third one of these and this is the best one by far.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"This readeri is compact and fits nicely in my bag. Easy to use, controls for children are very effective. Am glad I bought it."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,3,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"My first ebook reader. Read some reviews, decided to go with this because of the backlight and adaptive light. Sometimes I have to adjust the light manually but no biggie, quick and easy on the eyes."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent."

AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,4,"Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand."

I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working."
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,I had been reading books on my iPad for years and finally broke down to get a kindle. It's exactly what I hoped. The screen is easy to read in any light. It's a light weight and size and easy to stow away in a small bag.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.
AVphPmHuilAPnD_x3E5h,"Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 6"" - 4GB - Black",Electronics,5,"I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it."

I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing.

Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."

I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."

Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."

I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life."

Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead."

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,5,"For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!"

I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."

AVqkIhwDv8e3D1O-lebb,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.

I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."

The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."

AVpjEN4jLJeJML43rpUe,"Brand New Amazon Kindle Fire 16gb 7"" Ips Display Tablet Wifi 16 Gb Blue",Electronics,3,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."

AVpjEN4jLJeJML43rpUe,"Brand New Amazon Kindle Fire 16gb 7"" Ips Display Tablet Wifi 16 Gb Blue",Electronics,4,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."

AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner. The much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire.
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,4,the back light nad easier to read in all lightings
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,"Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands."
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train."
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,4,"This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite."
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,4,"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light"

AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,"I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi."
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it

AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!

AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,4,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it."
AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,As above a high class e reader. Love it. Use it at least 2-3 hrs daily.

AVpftoij1cnluZ0-p5n2,Amazon - Kindle Voyage - 4GB - Wi-Fi + 3G - Black,Electronics,5,Love the new Voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. Easier to tuck in my purse. The other plus is the auto light feature.

AVqVGZN9QMlgsOJE6eUZ,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,5,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
AVqVGZN9QMlgsOJE6eUZ,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,5,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"

WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"

Great device for home or on the go."
AVqVGZN9QMlgsOJE6eUZ,"Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",Electronics,5,"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!"

She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it.

That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have."

With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two)."

We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"

AVqkIh8WQMlgsOJE6fu-,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black",Electronics,5,I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
AVqkIiKWnnc1JgDc3khH,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,5,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time."
AVqkIiKWnnc1JgDc3khH,"All-New Fire HD 8 Tablet, 8"" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 32 GB - Includes Special Offers, Magenta",Electronics,4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."

It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's."
